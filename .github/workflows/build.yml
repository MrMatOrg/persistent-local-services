#
# Establish when the workflow is run
# We do build on every push except when we push onto main (which ought to be subject to branch protection)
# We do build whenever a PR onto main is closed (see on) and the code is actually merged (see release job if)
# Why is that okay?
# Since we're making a PR, we know from the previous workflow run on push that the repo is okay and the PR
# shows that to us. A PR itself doesn't cause a build, except when it is closed and the changes were merged.
